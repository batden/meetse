## Get started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/meetse.git .meetse
```

This creates a new hidden folder named **.meetse** in your home directory.

Copy the file meetse.sh from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x meetse.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./meetse.sh
```

### Update local repository

Change to ~/.meetse/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```

That's it.
